# Using PyTorch and TensorFlow

**Training Course Used**: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVqj1R71508

- ML is a subset of AI
- Algo's enable computer to perform tasks without explicit instruction
- Three types: Supervised (labelled data), Unsupervised (unlabeled data), and reinforcement learning (agent-environment interaction, delayed response)


## SECTION I: TensorFlow ##

- Flexible and scalable architecture for implementing machine learning models.
- Used in time series analysis forecasting
